# Friend-Finder-App

* This is a compatability based Friend Finder application. 

* This full-stack site takes in results from your users surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 

* The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Here's how the app works:

* The user's information and scores are stored using javascript objects in a json file.

* The survey page was built using CSS Bootstrap.

* As the user clicks on submit, the data is stored in a json file and a pop-up(modal) is displayed with the best match.

* Node and Express are used to handle the GET and POST requests.
